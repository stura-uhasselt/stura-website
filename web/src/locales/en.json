We are a motivated group of students who represent and defend the opinion of all students within our university. Because we are active within various organisms within our university, we have a say on different levels. This ranges from small organisms, such as the 'Food Committee' and the 'Library Policy Committee', to the highest, such as the 'Education council' and the 'UHasselt Board of Directors'. Because of this participation, we are seen as the co-administration of the university.<br><br>StuRa exists since 2004 and has always been actively solving problems and defending the opinion of students within the university. Feel free to read our reports or our list of projects to see what we are currently doing! You can always reach StuRa by contacting members, by visiting our open General Meetings, or through our 'Stuver' consultations, where each faculty coordinator meets the students from the evaluation meetings and OMTs.",

This academic year, this is from 10/04/2020 until 22/04/2020.<br><br>2) A period where every HU-student can vote for students from his or her faculty. This academic year, this is from 25/04/2020 until 12/05/2020.

If you weren't elected, you can apply for a function or mandate that has not been filled. Give it a shot! There were 2 function meetings before the exam period last academic year. Functions or mandates for which there is not time, will be moved to the first general meeting of the next academic year.<br><br>You weren't elected during elections or function meetings? Don't worry! Throughout the academic year you can still be co-opted. You can stand up for a mandate or for a function. We make a distinction between members, with voting rights, and collaborators, without voting rights, at the student council. If you stand for election in May and are subsequently elected, you are automatically a member. If you did not become a member during the elections, you can be co-opted as a member throughout the academic year. This is only possible if you stand up for a position with good motivation and the General Meeting (AV) subsequently elects you. A maximum of 2 members per faculty can be co-opted in addition to the maximum number of members of a faculty. You can also be co-opted as an collaborator if you argue for a mandate with good motivation and the AV elects you. You can also stand up for collaborator without taking a mandate. The advantage of being co-opted is that you get access to the drive and our internal communication.<br><br>Questions?

For example, practise their hobbies. Many students that play music instruments can't practice in their dorm because of the thin walls. Other things that can be integrated in this place are a small store, or additional study places.<br>Student Hotspot is the solution for all these issues. It'll be a multifunctional and cosy, but above all student-friendly place, created and maintained by and for students. Right now, we are trying to involve the municipalities of Hasselt and Diepenbeek in the project. We're also looking for a suited location. Hopefully, we can all enjoy this place next year allready!"

Een idee waar StuRa sterk achterstaat is het gebruik van een nieuwsbrief (via mail), die één of twee keer in de maand relevante informatie bundelt en werkt met doorkliklinks om meer informatie over een bepaald onderwerp te kunnen zien.

In het OER (onderwijs-, examen- en rechtspositieregeling) staat een adviesperiode waarin de resultaten worden beschikbaar worden gesteld van 10 dagen na de examenperiode. Dit is echter geen verplichting, waardoor er vorig academiejaar richtingen waren waarbij studenten tot wel 20 dagen moesten wachten vooraleer ze hun punten te zien kregen. Dit betekent al dat het volgende semester begint, je je hebt ingeschreven voor vakken, je deelneemt aan groepswerken etc., zonder zeker te zijn dat je op je vorige punten geslaagd bent. Hierdoor zou je je studietraject misschien anders willen samenstellen, zoals het opnemen van andere vakken, meer of minder vakken, het organiseren van hobby's in je tweede semester etc.<br>StuRa ijverde vorig jaar al om de adviesperiode bindend te maken. Dit werd afgewezen in de Onderwijsraad omwille van de werkoverlast die het zou veroorzaken. Wij vragen ons echter af waarom dit dan wel kan bij onze student-collega's op andere universiteiten, of waarom onze eigen, grootste faculteit (BEW) zich wel al aan de adviesperiode houdt, of waarom resultaten na het 2e semester veel sneller online komen te staan. Dit jaar wensen we deze argumenten te versterken door middel van een debat en enquête, waar je ongetwijfeld nog iets over zult zien in de wandelgangen!"

Ook wordt er veel minder plastic gebruikt in de verpakkingen en is er een groter aanbod voor de vegetariërs onder ons. Deze samenwerking moet natuurlijk worden onderhouden.
